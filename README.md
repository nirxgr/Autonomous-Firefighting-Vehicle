## Features

- Flame detection using sensors
- Autonomous navigation using BO motors
- Water spraying via pump and servo
- Arduino-based control system
- Safe, fast, and efficient fire response

## How It Works

1. **Flame sensors** detect fire and send data to **Arduino**.
2. Vehicle navigates toward the fire using **motor driver + BO motors**.
3. **Water pump and servo** spray water until fire is extinguished.
